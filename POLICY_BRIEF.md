## Executive Summary

West Virginia has made significant progress in broadband infrastructure deployment, with **71.6% of residents having access to high-speed internet**. However, **189,079 West Virginians (10.6% of the population)** still lack adequate broadband access, primarily in rural communities. This analysis suggests that targeted "last mile" infrastructure investment could achieve near-universal coverage more cost-effectively than comprehensive rebuilding.

## Key Findings

### Population-Weighted Analysis
- **189,079 people** lack broadband meeting federal standards (25+ Mbps)
- **10.6% underserved population** (significantly lower than national rural average of 25-30%)
- **256.6 Mbps population-weighted average speed** indicates strong infrastructure quality where it exists
- **92.1% of analyzed population lives in rural areas**, highlighting geographic service challenges

### Geographic Distribution
- **546 census tracts analyzed** across all 55 West Virginia counties
- **15,838 real speed test measurements** from Ookla data provide ground-truth verification
- Underserved areas concentrated in mountainous regions with challenging terrain and low population density

## Methodology & Data Quality

### Strengths
- **Population weighting** ensures analysis reflects actual impact on people, not just geographic coverage
- **Multiple data sources** (FCC reported coverage + real speed tests) provide comprehensive view
- **Census tract granularity** enables precise targeting of investment needs

### Limitations
- **Speed test bias:** Ookla data only includes users with existing internet connections who actively test speeds
- **Coverage gaps:** Most disconnected communities cannot participate in digital surveys
- **Conservative estimates:** 189,079 represents documented minimum; actual underserved population likely higher

## Policy Implications

### Investment Opportunity
- **Completion challenge, not creation challenge:** 71.6% coverage provides foundation for extending service
- **Manageable scope:** Connecting 189k people vs. building statewide infrastructure from scratch
- **Federal alignment:** Ideal use case for BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access & Deployment) funding

### Economic Development
- **Digital divide impact:** Rural residents lack equal access to remote work, telemedicine, education
- **Infrastructure multiplier:** Broadband enables other economic development initiatives
- **Competitive advantage:** Near-universal coverage would distinguish WV in regional competition

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize census tracts** with high population density and current underservice for maximum impact
2. **Leverage existing infrastructure** to reduce per-location connection costs
3. **Combine federal BEAD funding** with state and private investment for comprehensive approach
4. **Implement progress monitoring** using real speed test data to verify coverage improvements

## Technical Implementation

This analysis demonstrates how **open data + modern web mapping** can create policy-ready tools for infrastructure planning. The interactive map provides:
- **Export capabilities** for legislative presentations and grant applications
- **Real-time filtering** to explore different scenarios and thresholds
- **Professional reporting** suitable for federal funding applications
